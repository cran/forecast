\usage{accuracy(f, x, test=NULL, d=NULL, D=NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{f}{An object of class \code{"forecast"}, or a numerical vector containing forecasts. It will also work with \code{Arima}, \code{ets} and \code{lm} objects if \code{x} is omitted -- in which case in-sample accuracy measures are returned.}
\item{x}{An optional numerical vector containing actual values of the same length as object, or a time series overlapping with the times of \code{f}.}
\item{test}{Indicator of which elements of x and f to test. If \code{test} is \code{NULL}, all elements are used. Otherwise test is a numeric vector containing the indices of the elements to use in the test.}
\item{d}{An integer indicating the number of lag-1 differences to be used for the denominator in MASE calculation. Default value is 1 for non-seasonal series and 0 for seasonal series.}
\item{D}{An integer indicating the number of seasonal differences to be used for the denominator in MASE calculation. Default value is 0 for non-seasonal series and 1 for seasonal series.}
}

\description{Returns range of summary measures of the forecast accuracy. If \code{x} is provided, the function measures out-of-sample (test set) forecast accuracy
based on x-f. If \code{x} is not provided, the function only produces in-sample (training set) accuracy measures of the forecasts based on f["x"]-fitted(f).
All measures are defined and discussed in Hyndman and Koehler (2006).}

\details{
The measures calculated are:
\itemize{
\item ME: Mean Error
\item RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error
\item MAE: Mean Absolute Error
\item MPE: Mean Percentage Error
\item MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error
\item MASE: Mean Absolute Scaled Error
\item ACF1: Autocorrelation of errors at lag 1.
}
By default, the MASE calculation is scaled using MAE of in-sample naive forecasts for non-seasonal time series, in-sample seasonal naive forecasts for seasonal time series and in-sample mean forecasts for non-time series data.

See Hyndman and Koehler (2006) and Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2014, Section 2.5) for further details.
