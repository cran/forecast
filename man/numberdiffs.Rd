\description{Uses a unit root test to determine the number of differences required for time series \code{x}. If \code{test="kpss"},
the KPSS test is used with the null hypothesis that \code{x} has a stationary root against a unit-root alternative. Then the test returns 
the least number of differences required to pass the test at the level \code{alpha}. If \code{test="adf"}, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used
with the null hypothesis that \code{x} has a unit root against a stationary root alternative. Then the test returns the least number of differences
required to fail the test at the level \code{alpha}.}

\value{An integer.}
